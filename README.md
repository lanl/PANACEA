# PANACEA (Portable Approach for Novel Arrangements using a Cross Entropy Algorithm)

This is the repository for PANACEA. PANACEA provides a means for generating
unique configurations. The primary motivation for it's development was for
generating unique configurations for the purpose of training machine learned
interatomic potentials. 

# The Directory structure of this repository is layed out as

* include - public interface, where the header files are stored
* external - external and third party libraries used to build panacea
* src - where the source code is located
* tst - where the unit and integration tests are located

# Dependencies

* Eigen - matrix opertions
* Catch2 - for unit and integration testing
